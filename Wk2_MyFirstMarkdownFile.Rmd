My First R Markdown File
========================

This is my first R Markdown file.

Here we are going to load some data.
```{r}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a pairs plot of the data.

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model on wind, solar radiation and temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data=airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's an unordered list:

* first element

* second element

* third element

And here's an ordered list:

1. first element
1. second element
1. third element
